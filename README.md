# Distant Reader

The Distant Reader is a high performance computing (HPC) system which takes an almost arbitrary amount of unstructured data (text) as input and outputs a set of structured data for analysis -- "reading".

The Distant Reader takes one of five different types of input:

   1. a URL - good for blogs, single journal articles, or long reports
   2. a list of URLs - the most scalable, but creating the list can be problematic
   3. a file - good for that long PDF document on your computer
   4. a zip file - the zip file can contain just about any number of files from your computer
   5. a zip file plus a metadata file - with the metadata file, the readerâ€™s analysis is more complete
   
Given one or another of the possible inputs, the Distant Reader first caches the original content. It then transforms the content into a set of plain text files. Third, the Reader does text mining and natural language processing against the text files for the purpose of feature extraction: n-grams, parts-of-speech, named-entities, etc. The results of this process is a set of tab-delimited text files. The whole of the tab-delimited text files is then distilled into a relational database. A set of tabular and narrative reports is then generated against the database. The cache, transformed plain text files, tab-delimited files, relational database, and reports are then compressed ito a single (zip) file, and returned to the... reader. [1]

The returned file is affectionately called a "study carrel".  The student, researcher, or scholar is intended to peruse the study carrel for the purpose of supplementing the more traditional reading process. Use cases include:

   * the undergraduate student who needs to read everything for Sociology 101
   * the Ph.D. student who needs to understand the totality of their dissertation's bibliography
   * the scientist who is doing a literature review
   * the humanist who is studying all the works of a given genre

As an HPC, the Distant Reader is not a single computer program but instead a suite of software comprised of many individual scripts and applications. Personally, I see the scripts and applications akin to collection of poems used to make the output of human expression more cogent. Really. Seroiusly.

As a collection of scripts and applications, the Distant Reader has only been built by "standing on the shoulders of giants". Cited [here](https://distantreader.org/software-reference/) in no particular order nor necessarily complete, they include these below and more:

   * the Perl-based LWP modules - this software is a significant part of harvesting process
   * Wget - an absolutely wonderful Internt spidering application
   * Tika - a Java-based library which transforms just about any file into plain text
   * Spacy - a Python module which simplifies natural language processing operations
   * Gensim - another Python module for natural language processing
   * Textacy - a Python module building on the good work of Spacey
   * SQLite - a cross-platform, SQL-compliant relational database library/application
   * OpenStack - a tool for building virtual machines
   * Slurm - a tool for instantiating a cluster of computer nodes and what runs on them
   * Airivata - a Web-based suite of software used to monitor computing jobs on a cluster
   * Other Python Libraries - sqlalchemy, pandas, itertools, wordcloud, scipy, sklearn, networkx, textatistic, nltk
   * Other Perl Modules - DBI, JSON, Archive::Zip, WebService::Solr, XML::XPath, CGI, File::Basename, File::Copy, HTML::Entities, HTML::Escape
   * Javascript Libraries - bootstap, jquery 
   * Other Programs - csvstack

If you have any questions, then please don't hesitate to ask.

"Happy reading!"
